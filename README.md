# Just ignore CORS!

This is a simple node script (only using express and request) which will make a simple request to your provided url and returns it with correct CORS headers. 

## Usage
```
https://ignorecors-yipksgwdit.now.sh/?url=[full url-encoded url]
```

## Notices
Because this is a small side project, currently only JSON is supported. Also, because it's for free there is a fair use policy.
Now.sh provides 1GB of bandwidth per month, but you can still just use the code and host it yourself with now.sh.

_Also big thanks to [now.sh](https://now.sh) for their free OSS deployments._
