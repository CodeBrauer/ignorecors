# Just ignore CORS!

This is a simple node script (only using express and request) which will make a simple request to your provided url and returns it with correct CORS headers. 

## Usage
```
https://ignorecors-rvlqilkint.now.sh/?url=[full url-encoded url]
```

## Notices
Because this is a small side project, currently only JSON is supported. Also, because it's for free there is a fair use policy. Now.sh provides 1GB of bandwidth per month, which is shared for all of you!
You can still just use the code and host it yourself with now.sh.
thanks to now.sh for their free OSS deployments.
